# Primer Design Pipeline
* Example usage: \
`python ~/path/to/primerPipe.py --fastafile ~/Documents/testdata/sequence.fasta --included_region_start 2 --included_region_length 500 --num_of_assays 1000 --out_path ~/some/output/directory`
* The purpose of this program is to design qPCR or sequencing based on a given fasta file
* The fasta file can contain one gene or multiple genes.
* The program is designed to run batch jobs.
